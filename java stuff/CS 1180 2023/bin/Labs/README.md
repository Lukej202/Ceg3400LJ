# Project 1

## this project is a game that tests the users knolege by asking them 5 questions that have an aswer fr each data type String, Int, double, Boolean, and Char

## project guide

### you need to have java jdk and visual studio code installed to run the program

### to run the project in Visual Studio Code the top right corner there is a arrow button that will let you run the code if you press it

### to play the game you have to answer the 5 questions the program will prompt the user the questions will be asked one at a time each question will have a answer that is a different data type. the first answer is a string, second is an Int, third is a boolean, fourth is an double, and the last answer is a character.

## I learned the differences between each data type in this project and how to prompt the user for them and as well how to use them. a bug that had to be fixed was when checking if the string answer was correct it was not working because I was not using the .equals() function.
