## A game that lets the user create a hero and set the size of a catacomb and the hero must make it to the end of the catacomb by being in the final room and defeating monsters while making their way there.

## I have gotten a better understanding of classes and arrays from this project. The bug that I had the most problem with was using a 2d array for the catacomb so to fix it I dropped that idea of using the 2d array i still have it as a reference to set the positions of the monsters but after that the Actor class takes the work from there by setting each actors row and collum and then main checks if the hero is close to the monsters.
